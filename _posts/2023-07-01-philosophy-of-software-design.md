I consider this a must read for software developers. I would rate this higher than The Pragmatic Programmer if you are looking for a book to get your team to read.

This book identifies complexity as the real hurdle in software development and suggests several approaches to reduce complexity. It makes a compelling argument for why working software is not enough.
