A cute little game that Shannon and I played at the boardgame cafe. You build a town by placing resources in a pattern that match various building cards. The difficulty comes from only being able to choose the resources you have to place half of the time.

The rules are simple to learn, but there is a surprising amount of complexity under the surface.
