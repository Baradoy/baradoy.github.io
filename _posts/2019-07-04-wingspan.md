In terms of mechanics, Wingspan is a card based economy engine building game. Somehow that fits nicely into a theme of birds and bird facts. 

The theme is really what makes the game. Collecting birds, feeding them, and then having them lay little eggs that look like Cadbury Mini Eggs is a rather enjoyable and relaxing experience. 

Usually cards with random powers in a game diminishes my enjoyment of the game. Wingspan has mitigated that somewhat by keeping the variation on those powers low. But overall the core mechanics are not overly interesting.
