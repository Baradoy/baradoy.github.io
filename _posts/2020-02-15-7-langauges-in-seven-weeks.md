![7 Languages in Seven Weeks](/assets/7-languages-in-seven-weeks.jpg){:class="board-game-image"}

A quick introduction and comparison to Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell.

It probably wouldn't surprise anyone that knows how much I enjoy Elixir that I found Erlang and Haskell the most enjoyable to work with.

Io was interesting mostly because of the light it shed on Javascript. Prolog mostly gave me flashbacks to my Programming Paradigms class in my university days.

My thoughts on Scala and Clojure are complicated and I will save them for another post.

I think I will add Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks and Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks to my reading list.
