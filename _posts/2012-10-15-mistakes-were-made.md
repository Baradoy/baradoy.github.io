I discovered this book through the first episode of Sean Carroll's [Mindscape Podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/07/09/episode-1-carol-tavris-on-mistakes-justification-and-cognitive-dissonance/). It is a fascinating dive into cognitive dissonance. It takes a look at self-justification, the unreliability of memory, the satanic panic and cognitive biases.

I highly recommended reading this book.
