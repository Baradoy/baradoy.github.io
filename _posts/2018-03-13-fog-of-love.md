Fog of Love is a game that builds the story of a relationship. 

It is romantic in its nature. Shannon and I have found ourselves getting invested in the stories that the game builds. 

The characters in the story are never us, and sometimes we don't like the characters we play. The more the characters struggle to make the the relationship work the better the story.
