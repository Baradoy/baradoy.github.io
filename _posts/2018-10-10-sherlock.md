Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is Shannon and I's new favorite game to play together. The game is a set of ten mysteries that you solve following clues from location to location around London. We have made it through 6 of them so far and will probably get the next set once we are done those.

This game does highlight how bad of detective Sherlock Holmes is. He never confirms an alibi and he takes eyewitness accounts as reliable.

The game is great regardless.
