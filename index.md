I relocated from Calgary to Victoria in 2013 and have never looked back. From bike paths to breweries and hiking, I enjoy the quality of life Victoria provides.

I build software at [CoVault](http://covaultinc.com).
I am an organizer at [WhiskyDev](http://whiskydev.com) where we connect software developers through whisky.
On Thursdays I curl with my wonderful wife in the [Broom Under Water](http://www.broomunderwater.ca/) curling league at the Victoria Curling Club.
